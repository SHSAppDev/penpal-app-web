Hello, friend!
This folder contains mostly reusable, auxiliary scripts with specific functions;
however, inside the pages folder are scripts that pertain only to very specific
pages. e.g. login.js is exclusively for login.html .
(One exception is that dashboard.js is for index.html but hey gimme a break).
